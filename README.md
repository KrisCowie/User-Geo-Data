# User-Geo-Data

Please see the Notebooks folder for the 3 notebooks for the questions - Questions 1-3, Question 4a, and Question 4b.

There are examples of the visualization scheme used in Question 4a in the Maps folder, and one example still in the main notebook (it became too large when combining multiple different maps).

The files in the Maps folder are series of HTML files that can be opened with any standard browser to open a Folium map.
